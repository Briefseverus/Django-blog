                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As a third-year student, I have completed several projects in my journey as a computer science major. With a focus on Java and Python, I have developed several projects that have helped me grow my skills and knowledge.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I have always been passionate about Java programming and I believe it is a powerful language that has a lot of potential. I have completed several projects using Java, including a web application that tracks stocks and a desktop application for managing contacts. I have also worked on a few Python projects, such as a machine learning program that identifies handwritten digits and a simple web scraper.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In addition to these languages, I have also been experimenting with Flutter, which is a powerful framework for building beautiful and fast apps for mobile, web, and desktop. I am excited to continue exploring Flutter and its capabilities.</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Every day, I make an effort to acquire new knowledge.</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As a student, I have learned a lot about the importance of teamwork, communication, and time management. Working on group projects has taught me how to collaborate effectively with others and communicate ideas clearly. Time management has also been crucial, as I balance my coursework, extracurricular activities, and personal projects.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">My ultimate goal is to become a back-end Java developer. I believe that Java is a powerful language that can be used to develop complex, robust, and scalable applications. With my passion for Java and my experiences as a student, I am confident that I can achieve this goal.

I look forward to continuing my journey and exploring new technologies and projects. Stay tuned for updates on my progress and new projects!</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After 8 days, the gPBL program in Danang has finally come to an end. Despite differences in language and culture, the teams cooperated very well to complete their projects, ranging from a theft alert system and smart home to an IoT-based agricultural system.

This was an incredibly rewarding and memorable experience, exchanging knowledge and learning from Taiwanese and Japanese students who are all outstanding, friendly, and sociable. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to meet again in the near future.

Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to the teachers, professors, TAs, and everyone who made this program possible.

Thank you and goodbye gPBL2023! #GPBL2023</p>
